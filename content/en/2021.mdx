<h2>Hello everyone!</h2>
<p>The 8th of August is the birth date of Toki Pona. This year, we wanted to organise online event/concert/live show/celebration.</p>
<p>We have had the following activities planned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Songs, lectures, workshops and other games are here (have a look at the <a href="tenpo/">schedule</a>) </li>
  <li>Telephone game with toki pona translation: people take turns translating a sentence back and forth between toki pona and English without seeing previous translations, with hopefully amusing results. (If you want to join, please <a href="https://forms.gle/ByAEZRfxdUZCPn529" target="_blank">fill out this google form</a> or talk to jan Tepo (tbodt#7244).) </li>
  <li>Chess tournament</li>
  <li>
