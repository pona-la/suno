## Hello everyone!

The 8th of August is the birth date of Toki Pona. This year, we wanted to organise online event/concert/live show/celebration.

We have had the following activities planned:
* Songs, lectures, workshops and other games are here (have a look at the [schedule](tenpo))
* Wordcloud
* o toki e sitelen, o pali e sitelen

The event has been a huge success. Many of you showed up, and we couldn't be happier that you did. You can [see a playlist of the event on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjOmpMyMxd8TVr2MFw5AtXiypWMir8XfC) (it's still being updated with new videos). Thank you for the interest in the event, and see you next year!
