suno pi toki pona, also known as toki pona day, is a yearly toki pona event held on ma pona pi toki pona, started in 2021. on this day (a whole 24 hours of it!), we come together to celebrate toki pona and the community :) (we are moving it forward this year so that it can be on a weekend, where everyone is free.)

the event consists of a main track show,  24-hour stream in one of the discord voice channels in ma pona pi toki pona, mirrored on various other platforms such as youtube and twitch, filled with performances, talks, games, and presentations. take a look at the [schedule for 2023](tenpo)!
