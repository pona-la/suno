    "description": "Background:\nFor months, Ma Toki Pona VR has been hosting weekly events in VRChat for learning Toki Pona. During these events, participants share social context through a spatial environment. This works well for learning as an alternative to text/voice-only mediums like Discord! Our weekly meetups welcome all; complete beginners are encouraged to join!\n\nMeetup schedule:\n15 minutes after opening, we hold announcements. Then jan Kekan San gives a half-hour lesson. Then we go play a game while speaking Toki Pona. Then we go to a museum world to use Toki Pona in a more realistic environment.\n\nOnce a month, we hold a joint meetup with Projekto Babel, a multilingual community based in Japan. During these meetups, we use Toki Pona as a bridge between English and Japanese!\n\nProposal:\nFor Suno pi Toki Pona, the Ma Toki Pona VR and Projekto Babel communities are inviting viewers to watch the stream in VRChat. We are building a venue world to hang out in and watch the stream. During the stream, we'd like 15 minutes to introduce our community. We would also like to hold other panels streamed from VRChat. These panels will be submitted as additional proposals. (These have been submitted by jan Kekan San.)\n\nLimitations:\nVRChat maps are limited to 80 users. The VRChat venue will be designed for the Quest for hardware accessibility. No VR equipment is required, but the in-game live stream only works on Windows. Participants may stream the event if they choose.",

    "description": "One of the first major hurdles a new learner to Toki Pona faces is expressing ideas with the languages limited vocabulary. Having memorized the vocabulary and successfully understood simple sentences, a learner begins to explore the world around them using Toki Pona. However, many learners get stuck in the idea that concepts which are single words or short phrases in their parent language should be expressed in a single grammatical position in Toki Pona. This lesson is intended to dispell that notion, replacing it: proper toki pona expresses ideas most powerfully in simple parts, and complex phrases building into single sentences are less approachable than multiple simple sentences consecutively.\n\nThis lesson would be progressive, beginning with expressing some of the nimi ku suli and popular nimi ku lili given only the nimi pu (jasima, lanpan, majuna for example), and moving on to more advanced ideas such as expressing differences between species of tree, describing the inner functionings of a computer, and more as time allows.\n\nThis lesson is intended to be accessible to beginners, so it will be primarily given in English, since the majority of new learners are English speakers. However, there will be expressions in Toki Pona, intermixed with \"toki ponglish\" renditions of those sentences.\n\nThe plan is to hold this presentation within VRChat, after the introduction to the project babel and ma toki pona vr community. If that turns out to not be possible, I will host my presentation outside the game.",

    "description": "There are many nasin pi toki pona defined by the community. Some are expressly defined by the use of new words, and others are defined by rejecting parts of nasin pu. Further, there are exploratory nasin in use by a very small number of speakers, understandable to open-minded toki pona speakers but obscure nonetheless.\n\nI will present on the differences in toki pona given the following nasin:\n\n- jon't: a reduction or complete rejection of the word `jo`, as compared to pu.\n- pin't: a complete rejection of the word `pi` in favor of using more statements for description.\n- anun't: a rejection of anu for sentence structure, disallowing anu use outside of \"anu seme\"; it cannot be used to connect verbs or objects, for example.\n- transitive prepositions: using a prepositional phrase in the verb position, together with an object that prep phrase applies to\n\nI have not run a test presentation yet; if there is sufficient time, I would also explore the following nasin:\n\n- preverbn't: no use of preverbs. Explore this by comparing the use of open/pini preverbs to not using them, then go from there.\n- jan't: no use of jan, or at least not for yourself. Many speakers are not jan!\n- min't: no use of mi, and maybe not sina either. Always referencing speaker/listener in third person!\n\nThis presentation would come with a disclaimer at the start: these lessons aren't intended as nasin nanpa wan!
